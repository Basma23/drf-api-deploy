- **NOTE:** You can use previous lab’s Application as a starting point or start from scratch.
- Modify your application to store SECRET_KEY, ALLOWED_HOSTS, DEBUG and DATABASE information in ```.env``` file.
- Add CORS capabilities to your app and whitelist allowed origins.
- All the code changes will be in ```settings.py``` so check the demo code for CORS and Env related lines.
- In a nutshell - make your own Application similar to the demo, and put it on the web.

## Deployment Requirements

- **NOTE** no money is required for this lab but you may choose to create a trial account.
